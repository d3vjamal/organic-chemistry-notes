# Chapter 19: Alcohols, Phenols, and Ethers

## Introduction
This chapter covers the structure, properties, preparation, and reactions of alcohols, phenols, and ethers - important classes of organic compounds containing oxygen.

## Alcohols
### Structure and Classification
- Primary alcohols: R-CH₂-OH
- Secondary alcohols: R₂-CH-OH  
- Tertiary alcohols: R₃-C-OH

### Preparation of Alcohols
1. **From alkenes** - Hydration, oxymercuration-demercuration
2. **From aldehydes and ketones** - Reduction using NaBH₄ or LiAlH₄
3. **From Grignard reagents** - Addition to carbonyl compounds
4. **From esters** - Reduction with LiAlH₄

### Reactions of Alcohols
1. **Oxidation** - Primary → aldehydes → carboxylic acids; Secondary → ketones
2. **Dehydration** - Formation of alkenes (E1/E2 mechanisms)
3. **Substitution** - Formation of alkyl halides (SN1/SN2)
4. **Esterification** - Formation of esters with carboxylic acids

## Phenols
### Structure and Properties
- Aromatic compounds with -OH group directly attached to benzene ring
- More acidic than alcohols due to resonance stabilization
- pKa ≈ 10 (compared to alcohols pKa ≈ 16)

### Preparation of Phenols
1. **From benzene sulphonic acid** - Alkali fusion
2. **From chlorobenzene** - Nucleophilic substitution at high temperature
3. **From cumene** - Industrial process via cumene hydroperoxide
4. **From aniline** - Diazotization followed by hydrolysis

### Reactions of Phenols
1. **Electrophilic aromatic substitution** - Highly activated benzene ring
2. **Oxidation** - Formation of quinones
3. **Kolbe reaction** - Carboxylation with CO₂ under pressure
4. **Reimer-Tiemann reaction** - Formylation with CHCl₃/NaOH

## Ethers
### Structure and Classification
- R-O-R' where R and R' can be alkyl or aryl groups
- Symmetrical ethers: R-O-R
- Unsymmetrical ethers: R-O-R'

### Preparation of Ethers
1. **Williamson ether synthesis** - SN2 reaction between alkoxide and alkyl halide
2. **Dehydration of alcohols** - Intermolecular dehydration at 140°C
3. **From alkenes** - Addition of alcohols in presence of acid

### Reactions of Ethers
1. **Cleavage with HI/HBr** - Formation of alkyl halides
2. **Autoxidation** - Formation of explosive peroxides
3. **Friedel-Crafts reactions** - For aromatic ethers

## Points to Remember

1. **Alcohol acidity order**: Primary > Secondary > Tertiary (due to +I effect)
2. **Phenol is more acidic than alcohol** due to resonance stabilization of phenoxide ion
3. **Lucas test** distinguishes primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols
4. **Williamson synthesis** is best for preparing ethers, especially with primary halides
5. **Phenol gives violet color with FeCl₃** - characteristic test
6. **Ether cleavage follows SN2 mechanism** with primary alkyl groups and SN1 with tertiary
7. **Intramolecular hydrogen bonding** makes ortho-substituted phenols less acidic
8. **Grignard reagents react with alcohols** to give alkanes and magnesium alkoxide
9. **Phenols undergo coupling reactions** with diazonium salts to form azo dyes
10. **Ethers are relatively unreactive** except under harsh conditions
11. **Diethyl ether forms explosive peroxides** on exposure to air and light
12. **Phenol polymerizes with formaldehyde** to give Bakelite (phenol-formaldehyde resin)
13. **Alcohols show hydrogen bonding** leading to higher boiling points
14. **Crown ethers** can complex with metal ions due to their cavity structure
15. **Pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement** involves 1,2-diol to ketone conversion
