# Chapter 27: Reduction

## Introduction
Reduction reactions in organic chemistry involve the addition of hydrogen (H₂) or the removal of oxygen from organic compounds. These reactions are fundamental in synthetic organic chemistry and often involve the use of reducing agents.

## Types of Reduction Reactions

### 1. Hydrogenation
- **Definition**: Addition of hydrogen (H₂) across multiple bonds
- **Common catalyst**: Pt, Pd, Ni (heterogeneous catalysis)
- **Conditions**: High pressure and temperature

#### Examples:
- **Alkenes to Alkanes**: C=C + H₂ → C-C
- **Alkynes to Alkenes/Alkanes**: C≡C + H₂ → C=C + H₂ → C-C
- **Aromatic compounds**: Benzene + 3H₂ → Cyclohexane

### 2. Metal Hydride Reductions

#### Lithium Aluminum Hydride (LiAlH₄)
- **Solvent**: Dry ether or THF
- **Conditions**: Anhydrous conditions
- **Reduces**:
  - Aldehydes → Primary alcohols
  - Ketones → Secondary alcohols
  - Carboxylic acids → Primary alcohols
  - Esters → Primary alcohols
  - Amides → Amines

#### Sodium Borohydride (NaBH₄)
- **Solvent**: Protic solvents (water, alcohols)
- **Selectivity**: More selective than LiAlH₄
- **Reduces**:
  - Aldehydes → Primary alcohols
  - Ketones → Secondary alcohols
  - Does NOT reduce carboxylic acids or esters under normal conditions

### 3. Catalytic Hydrogenation

#### Heterogeneous Catalysis
- **Catalysts**: Pt, Pd, Ni, Rh
- **Mechanism**: Surface adsorption of H₂ and substrate
- **Stereochemistry**: Syn addition (both hydrogens add from same face)

#### Homogeneous Catalysis
- **Wilkinson's Catalyst**: RhCl(PPh₃)₃
- **Advantage**: Milder conditions, better selectivity
- **Applications**: Asymmetric hydrogenation

### 4. Dissolving Metal Reductions

#### Birch Reduction
- **Reagents**: Na or Li in liquid NH₃, alcohol
- **Substrate**: Aromatic rings
- **Product**: 1,4-cyclohexadienes
- **Mechanism**: Radical anion intermediate

#### Clemmensen Reduction
- **Reagents**: Zn(Hg), HCl
- **Substrate**: Ketones/aldehydes adjacent to aromatic rings
- **Product**: Alkanes (complete reduction of C=O)
- **Conditions**: Strongly acidic

#### Wolff-Kishner Reduction
- **Reagents**: NH₂NH₂, KOH, heat
- **Substrate**: Ketones and aldehydes
- **Product**: Alkanes
- **Conditions**: Strongly basic
- **Advantage**: Avoids acidic conditions

## Selectivity in Reductions

### Chemoselectivity
- Different functional groups reduced at different rates
- Example: NaBH₄ reduces aldehydes faster than ketones

### Regioselectivity
- Direction of addition in unsymmetrical substrates
- Important in alkyne reductions

### Stereoselectivity
- Control of stereochemistry in reduction products
- **Syn addition**: Catalytic hydrogenation
- **Anti addition**: Some dissolving metal reductions

## Biological Reductions

### NADH and NADPH
- **Role**: Biological reducing agents
- **Function**: Transfer hydride ions in enzymatic reactions
- **Importance**: Metabolism, biosynthesis

### Enzymatic Reductions
- **Alcohol dehydrogenases**: Reduce aldehydes/ketones
- **Reductases**: Various substrate-specific enzymes
- **Advantage**: High selectivity, mild conditions

## Synthetic Applications

### Total Synthesis
- Reduction reactions are key steps in complex molecule synthesis
- Control of stereochemistry crucial for natural product synthesis

### Industrial Applications
- **Hydrogenation of oils**: Food industry
- **Pharmaceutical synthesis**: Drug manufacturing
- **Petrochemicals**: Fuel and chemical production

## Mechanism Considerations

### Hydride Transfer
- Metal hydrides transfer H⁻ to electrophilic carbon
- Carbonyl carbon becomes nucleophilic after hydride addition

### Radical Mechanisms
- Dissolving metal reductions often proceed via radical intermediates
- Single electron transfer (SET) processes

### Surface Catalysis
- Heterogeneous hydrogenation involves surface adsorption
- Both substrate and H₂ adsorb to catalyst surface

## Protecting Groups
- Some functional groups may need protection during reduction
- **Acetals/Ketals**: Protect aldehydes/ketones
- **Silyl ethers**: Protect alcohols

## Side Reactions and Limitations

### Over-reduction
- Risk of reducing product further than desired
- Control through choice of reducing agent and conditions

### Functional Group Incompatibility
- Some groups incompatible with reducing conditions
- Example: LiAlH₄ incompatible with protic solvents

### Catalyst Poisoning
- Sulfur, phosphorus compounds can deactivate metal catalysts
- Requires pure starting materials

## Summary
Reduction reactions are essential transformations in organic chemistry, providing access to alcohols, alkanes, and amines from more oxidized precursors. The choice of reducing agent depends on:
- Substrate structure
- Desired selectivity
- Reaction conditions
- Functional group compatibility

Understanding the mechanisms and limitations of different reducing agents is crucial for successful synthetic applications.

## Practice Problems
1. Predict the product of reducing acetone with NaBH₄
2. What reducing agent would convert benzoic acid to benzyl alcohol?
3. Explain why LiAlH₄ cannot be used in protic solvents
4. Draw the mechanism for Birch reduction of toluene
5. Compare the selectivity of NaBH₄ vs LiAlH₄ for reducing a compound containing both aldehyde and ester groups
