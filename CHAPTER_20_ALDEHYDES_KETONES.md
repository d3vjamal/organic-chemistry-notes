# Chapter 20: Aldehydes and Ketones

## Introduction
Aldehydes and ketones are carbonyl compounds with the C=O functional group, playing crucial roles in organic chemistry and biochemistry.

## Structure and Properties
### Aldehydes (R-CHO)
- Carbonyl carbon bonded to at least one hydrogen
- Formyl group (-CHO) at terminal position
- Examples: Formaldehyde (HCHO), Acetaldehyde (CH₃CHO)

### Ketones (R-CO-R')
- Carbonyl carbon bonded to two alkyl/aryl groups
- C=O group in the middle of carbon chain
- Examples: Acetone (CH₃COCH₃), Benzophenone (C₆H₅COC₆H₅)

### Physical Properties
- Polar molecules due to C=O bond
- Higher boiling points than hydrocarbons (dipole-dipole interactions)
- Lower aldehydes and ketones soluble in water (hydrogen bonding)
- Solubility decreases with increasing carbon chain length

## Preparation of Aldehydes
### From Primary Alcohols
1. **Oxidation with PCC** - Mild oxidizing agent in anhydrous conditions
2. **Swern oxidation** - (COCl)₂, DMSO, Et₃N at low temperature
3. **Dess-Martin periodinane** - Mild conditions, high yields

### From Carboxylic Acid Derivatives
1. **Reduction of acid chlorides** - DIBAL-H at -78°C
2. **Rosenmund reduction** - Pd/BaSO₄, H₂, quinoline

### From Alkenes
1. **Ozonolysis** - O₃ followed by Zn/AcOH or Me₂S
2. **Wacker oxidation** - PdCl₂, CuCl₂, O₂, H₂O

## Preparation of Ketones
### From Secondary Alcohols
1. **Oxidation** - Jones reagent, PCC, or Swern oxidation
2. **Oppenauer oxidation** - Al(OiPr)₃, acetone

### From Carboxylic Acids
1. **Friedel-Crafts acylation** - RCOCl, AlCl₃
2. **From nitriles** - Grignard addition followed by hydrolysis

### From Alkenes
1. **Ozonolysis** - For internal alkenes
2. **Hydration** - Markovnikov addition with acid catalysis

## Reactions of Aldehydes and Ketones

### Nucleophilic Addition Reactions
1. **Addition of water** - Hydrate formation (reversible)
2. **Addition of alcohols** - Hemiacetal/hemiketal and acetal/ketal formation
3. **Addition of ammonia derivatives**
   - Primary amines → Imines (Schiff bases)
   - Hydroxylamine → Oximes
   - Hydrazine → Hydrazones
   - Phenylhydrazine → Phenylhydrazones
   - Semicarbazide → Semicarbazones

### Reduction Reactions
1. **Catalytic hydrogenation** - Ni, Pd, or Pt catalyst
2. **Metal hydride reduction**
   - NaBH₄ → Primary/secondary alcohols
   - LiAlH₄ → Primary/secondary alcohols
3. **Clemmensen reduction** - Zn/HCl → Alkanes
4. **Wolff-Kishner reduction** - NH₂NH₂, KOH, heat → Alkanes

### Oxidation Reactions
1. **Aldehydes to carboxylic acids**
   - Tollens' reagent - [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺ (Silver mirror test)
   - Fehling's reagent - Cu²⁺ in alkaline medium
   - Benedict's reagent - Cu²⁺ in citrate medium
   - Jones reagent - CrO₃/H₂SO₄
2. **Ketones** - Generally resistant to mild oxidation

### α-Hydrogen Reactions
1. **Aldol condensation** - Self-condensation in basic medium
2. **Cross-aldol condensation** - Between different carbonyl compounds
3. **Halogenation** - α-Hydrogen replacement with halogens
4. **Haloform reaction** - CHX₃ formation with methyl ketones

## Important Named Reactions

### Aldol Condensation
- Base-catalyzed self-condensation
- Forms β-hydroxy aldehydes/ketones
- Dehydration gives α,β-unsaturated compounds

### Cannizzaro Reaction
- Disproportionation of aldehydes without α-hydrogen
- One molecule oxidized, another reduced
- Requires strong base (NaOH)

### Pinacol-Pinacolone Rearrangement
- Acid-catalyzed rearrangement of vicinal diols
- 1,2-migration of alkyl groups
- Forms ketones from diols

### Benzoin Condensation
- Cyanide-catalyzed condensation of aromatic aldehydes
- Forms α-hydroxy ketones (benzoins)
- Thiamine-catalyzed biological version

## Points to Remember

1. **Aldehyde vs Ketone reactivity**: Aldehydes more reactive than ketones due to less steric hindrance
2. **Tollens' test**: Aldehydes give silver mirror, ketones don't react
3. **Fehling's and Benedict's tests**: Aldehydes reduce Cu²⁺ to Cu₂O (brick red precipitate)
4. **Iodoform test**: Methyl ketones give yellow CHI₃ precipitate
5. **Aldol condensation**: Requires α-hydrogen for enolate formation
6. **Nucleophilic addition mechanism**: Carbonyl carbon is electrophilic
7. **Hydrate stability**: Formaldehyde exists mainly as hydrate in water
8. **Acetals and ketals**: Stable in basic medium, hydrolyze in acid
9. **Cannizzaro reaction**: Only for aldehydes without α-hydrogen
10. **Grignard addition**: Forms tertiary alcohols with ketones, secondary with aldehydes
11. **Enol-keto tautomerism**: Keto form usually more stable
12. **α,β-Unsaturated carbonyls**: Undergo conjugate addition (Michael addition)
13. **Protecting groups**: Acetals/ketals protect carbonyls during synthesis
14. **Biological importance**: Glucose (hemiacetal), fructose (hemiketal)
15. **Industrial uses**: Formaldehyde (plastics), acetone (solvent), acetaldehyde (chemicals)
