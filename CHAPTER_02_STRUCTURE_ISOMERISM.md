# CHAPTER 02: STRUCTURE ISOMERISM

## Introduction
Structure isomerism (also known as constitutional isomerism) occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements of atoms. This results in different connectivity patterns between atoms, leading to compounds with distinct physical and chemical properties.

## Types of Structure Isomerism

### 1. Chain Isomerism (Skeletal Isomerism)

**Definition:** Chain isomerism occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula but different carbon skeleton arrangements. The difference lies in the branching pattern of the carbon chain.

**Conditions:**
- Same molecular formula
- Different carbon skeleton (straight chain vs. branched chain)
- Different connectivity of carbon atoms

**Examples:**
1. **Butane (C₄H₁₀):**
   - n-Butane: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ (straight chain)
   - Isobutane: (CH₃)₃CH (branched chain)

2. **Pentane (C₅H₁₂):**
   - n-Pentane: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃ (straight chain)
   - Isopentane: (CH₃)₂CH-CH₂-CH₃ (branched chain)

### 2. Positional Isomerism

**Definition:** Positional isomerism occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula and functional groups, but the functional group is attached to different positions on the carbon chain.

**Conditions:**
- Same molecular formula
- Same functional group
- Different position of functional group on the carbon skeleton

**Examples:**
1. **Propanol (C₃H₈O):**
   - 1-Propanol: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-OH (OH group on terminal carbon)
   - 2-Propanol: CH₃-CH(OH)-CH₃ (OH group on middle carbon)

2. **Butene (C₄H₈):**
   - 1-Butene: CH₃-CH₂-CH=CH₂ (double bond between C1 and C2)
   - 2-Butene: CH₃-CH=CH-CH₃ (double bond between C2 and C3)

### 3. Functional Isomerism

**Definition:** Functional isomerism occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula but different functional groups, resulting in different chemical properties.

**Conditions:**
- Same molecular formula
- Different functional groups
- Different chemical properties

**Examples:**
1. **C₂H₆O:**
   - Ethanol: CH₃-CH₂-OH (alcohol functional group)
   - Dimethyl ether: CH₃-O-CH₃ (ether functional group)

2. **C₃H₆O:**
   - Propanal: CH₃-CH₂-CHO (aldehyde functional group)
   - Acetone: CH₃-CO-CH₃ (ketone functional group)

### 4. Metamerism

**Definition:** Metamerism is a special type of structural isomerism where compounds have the same molecular formula and functional group, but differ in the distribution of carbon atoms around the functional group or heteroatom.

**Conditions:**
- Same molecular formula
- Same functional group
- Different alkyl groups attached to the same functional group
- Commonly observed in ethers, thioethers, and secondary amines

**Examples:**
1. **Diethyl ether vs. Methyl propyl ether (C₄H₁₀O):**
   - Diethyl ether: CH₃-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH₃
   - Methyl propyl ether: CH₃-O-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃

2. **Secondary amines (C₄H₁₁N):**
   - Diethylamine: (CH₃-CH₂)₂NH
   - Methylpropylamine: CH₃-NH-CH₂-CH₂-CH₃

### 5. Tautomerism

**Definition:** Tautomerism is a special type of structural isomerism involving rapid interconversion between two or more structural forms (tautomers) that exist in dynamic equilibrium. It involves the migration of a proton and the shifting of bonding electrons.

**Conditions:**
- Rapid equilibrium between structural forms
- Migration of hydrogen atom (usually H⁺)
- Shift in position of double bond
- Catalyzed by acids or bases

**Examples:**
1. **Keto-Enol Tautomerism:**
   - Acetone (keto form): CH₃-CO-CH₃
   - Enol form: CH₃-C(OH)=CH₂

2. **Aldehyde-Enol Tautomerism:**
   - Acetaldehyde (aldehyde form): CH₃-CHO
   - Enol form: CH₂=CH-OH

## Key Points to Remember

1. **Structural isomers** have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements
2. **Chain isomerism** involves different carbon skeleton arrangements
3. **Positional isomerism** involves different positions of functional groups
4. **Functional isomerism** involves different functional groups
5. **Metamerism** involves different alkyl group distributions around heteroatoms
6. **Tautomerism** involves dynamic equilibrium between structural forms

## Significance

Structural isomerism is fundamental in organic chemistry as it explains how compounds with identical molecular formulas can have vastly different properties. Understanding these concepts is crucial for:
- Predicting chemical behavior
- Designing synthetic pathways
- Understanding biological activity
- Pharmaceutical development
