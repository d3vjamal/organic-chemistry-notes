# Chapter 4: Organic Reactions

## 4.1 Types of Organic Reactions

### Addition Reactions
- **Definition**: Two or more molecules combine to form a single product
- **Example**: Alkene + HBr → Alkyl halide
- **Mechanism**: Electrophilic addition

### Substitution Reactions
- **Nucleophilic Substitution (SN1 and SN2)**
  - SN1: Unimolecular, involves carbocation intermediate
  - SN2: Bimolecular, concerted mechanism
- **Electrophilic Substitution**
  - Common in aromatic compounds
  - Examples: Nitration, halogenation, sulfonation

### Elimination Reactions
- **E1 Mechanism**: Unimolecular elimination
- **E2 Mechanism**: Bimolecular elimination
- **Products**: Alkenes (and sometimes alkynes)

## 4.2 Reaction Mechanisms

### Key Concepts
- **Intermediates**: Carbocations, carbanions, radicals
- **Transition States**: High-energy states during bond breaking/forming
- **Energy Diagrams**: Show reaction coordinate vs energy

### Factors Affecting Reaction Rates
1. **Temperature**: Higher temperature → faster reaction
2. **Concentration**: Higher concentration → faster reaction
3. **Catalysts**: Lower activation energy
4. **Solvent Effects**: Polar vs nonpolar solvents

## 4.3 Important Organic Reactions

### Grignard Reactions
- **Reagent**: R-Mg-X (organomagnesium compounds)
- **Uses**: Formation of C-C bonds
- **Conditions**: Anhydrous ether, inert atmosphere

### Aldol Condensation
- **Mechanism**: Enolate formation followed by nucleophilic addition
- **Products**: β-hydroxy aldehydes/ketones
- **Applications**: Carbon chain extension

### Diels-Alder Reaction
- **Type**: [4+2] Cycloaddition
- **Reactants**: Diene + Dienophile
- **Product**: Cyclohexene derivative
- **Stereospecificity**: Syn addition

## 4.4 Oxidation and Reduction

### Oxidation Reactions
- **Primary alcohols** → Aldehydes → Carboxylic acids
- **Secondary alcohols** → Ketones
- **Common reagents**: KMnO₄, K₂Cr₂O₇, PCC

### Reduction Reactions
- **Aldehydes/Ketones** → Alcohols
- **Carboxylic acids** → Primary alcohols
- **Common reagents**: LiAlH₄, NaBH₄

## 4.5 Protecting Groups

### Definition
- Temporary modification of functional groups
- Prevents unwanted reactions during synthesis

### Common Protecting Groups
- **Alcohols**: Silyl ethers (TMS, TBDMS)
- **Amines**: Boc, Fmoc groups
- **Carbonyls**: Acetals, ketals

## 4.6 Summary Points

1. Reaction mechanisms explain how bonds break and form
2. Understanding intermediates is crucial for predicting products
3. Reaction conditions (temperature, solvent, catalysts) affect outcomes
4. Stereochemistry must be considered in reaction planning
5. Protecting groups enable complex multi-step syntheses
